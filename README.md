# CMSC203 Assignment3

In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot. In an encryption scheme, the intended information or message, referred to as plaintext, is encrypted using an encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating ciphertext that can be read only if decrypted. 

The Enigma machines were a family of portable cipher machines with rotor scramblers that became Nazi Germany's principal crypto-system. It was broken by the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau in December 1932, with the aid of French-supplied intelligence material obtained from a German spy.

## Assignment Description

Write a Java program to encrypt and decrypt a phrase using two similar approaches, each insecure by modern standards.  

The first approach is called the Caesar Cipher, and is a simple “substitution cipher” where characters in a message are replaced by a substitute character.

The second approach, due to Giovan Battista Bellaso (b 1505, d 1581), uses a key word, where each character in the word specifies the offset for the corresponding character in the message, with the key word wrapping around as needed.
